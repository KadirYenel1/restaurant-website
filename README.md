<h1>Restaurant-Website Project</h1>

Hello friends! After a long effort, I have created an amazing restaurant website using my skills. In this project, the semantic power of HTML5, the flexible design capabilities of CSS3, and the dynamic features of JavaScript came together. I utilized the latest technologies to provide a user-friendly interface on every page. In the menu and products section, my goal was to stimulate users' appetites with rich content and impressive visuals. Thanks to responsive design, users can easily navigate the website on any device.
